# Vanilla-JS


#### Goal of this repo: practice JS daily

Since I do not write JS daily at work, I practice JS before and or after work hours (daily) (9-5)

So this repo is a growing list of of my Vanilla Javascript notes and snippets of code examples. 

These examples are all apart of my JS journey, as I continue to grow and learn either through 
articles or online courses I will continue to build mini projects and document my journey.

---- 

Each folder includes an index.html file and a app.js file -
The index.html is simply there just incase I need to render someting to the DOM,
mostly you will see a random image generated via UNSPLAH https://unsplash.com/

Hopefully as I look over these notes of patters and techniques, maybe this will be of benefit to someoneone else.
As I go along i'll try to remember to include links to the sources to learn more about the patterns.
