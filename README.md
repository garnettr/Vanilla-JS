# Vanilla-JS


A growing list of of Vanilla Javascript snippets, or rather notes of code examples. 
This list will continue to grow as I continue to learn new JS patterns.

### Feel free to poke around in the app.js files.

* Call Apply Bind 

* IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) 

* Objects $ This

* Constructors and Classes 

* Function Expressions


### Mini projects that are used to practice the skills above:
