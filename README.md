# Vanilla-JS


#### Goal of this repo: practice JS daily

Since I do not write JS daily at work, I practice JS before and or after work hours (9-5)

So this repo is a growing list of of my Vanilla Javascript snippets and notes of code examples. 

These examples are all apart of my JS journey, as I continue to grow and learn either through 
articles or online courses I will continue to practice and document my journey.

Each folder includes an index.html file and a app.js file -
The index.html is simply there just incase I need to render someting to the DOM,
